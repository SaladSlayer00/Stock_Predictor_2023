# Stock Price Prediction 

A machine learning project to predict stock price movements using historical data and financial indicators. Built with Python, Spark, and modern deep learning techniques. 

## Purpose
Accurately forecasting stock prices can provide valuable insights for investors and traders. However, this is a challenging task due to nonlinear dynamics in the market. This project applies advanced algorithms to uncover patterns in the complex interactions between shares and macroeconomic factors.

## Demo  
A Streamlit web app is provided to demo model performance in real-time

## Data
Daily stock data for TSLA from 2010-present obtained from Yahoo Finance. Macroeconomic indicators like S&P 500 from FRED are also included. Over 10 years of historical market context is analyzed.

## Models  
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosted Trees
- Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM)

## Results
The LSTM Neural Network achieved the best performance with a RMSE of 0.057 on the test set, outperforming other algorithms.

## Usage
Instructions provided to run the full codebase locally or on Databricks for reproducibility. The web app allows interacting with a live model.

## Roadmap
Enhancements like adding new deep learning architectures and risk analysis are planned for future iterations. Contributions welcome!
